**1. Study of Deep learning Packages: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and PyTorch. Document the distinct 
features and functionality of the packages.** <br>

**2. Implementing Feedforward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow** <br>
a. Import the necessary packages <br>
b. Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10) <br>
c. Define the network architecture using Keras <br>
d. Train the model using SGD <br>
e. Evaluate the network <br>
f. Plot the training loss and accuracy <br>

**3. Build the Image classification model by dividing the model into following 4 stages:** <br>
a. Loading and preprocessing the image data<br>
b. Defining the model’s architecture<br>
c. Training the model<br>
d. Estimating the model’s performance<br>

**4. Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection. Build the model by using:** <br>
a. Import required libraries <br>
b. Upload / access the dataset <br>
c. Encoder converts it into latent representation <br>
d. Decoder networks convert it back to the original input <br>
e. Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics <br>

**5. Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model. Stages can be:** <br>
a. Data preparation <br>
b. Generate training data <br>
c. Train model <br>
d. Output <br>

**6. Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures** <br>
a. Load in a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset <br>
b. Freeze parameters (weights) in model’s lower convolutional layers <br>
c. Add custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to model <br>
d. Train classifier layers on training data available for task <br>
e. Fine-tune hyper parameters and unfreeze more layers as needed <br>
